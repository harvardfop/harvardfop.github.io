### Mission Statement

The mission of FOP is to provide group adventure-based experiences that promote the development of social support and self-awareness for first-year students, and leadership development for members of the Harvard community.

FOP should be a resource and support system throughout a student’s first year. FOP also maintains the following as central values:
- Compassion
- The equality and intrinsic worth of all people regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation,
religion, ethnic or socio-economic background
- Responsibility to community
- Care and responsibility to the environment

The First-Year Outdoor Program was established in 1979 and it is the oldest and largest pre-orientation program at Harvard College. Each year, more than 20 percent of incoming first-years participate in 6-day trips led by more than 80 sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

Dean of Freshmen Henry Moses first conceived of having an outdoor orientation program at Harvard, and with the help of Cate Huisman, FOP offered its first trips for 49 students in 1979. Each of the ten subsequent directors -- Jeff Smith, Vic Henningsen, Steve Whisnant, John Duvivier, Sharon Bassett, Beth Bellman, Brent Bell, Jessica Ross, Paul "Coz" Teplitz, and current director Emily "Quigs" Quigley -- has added their own unique vision to the FOP program. The basic premise, however, has always been that the wilderness is a unique learning environment that provides a setting in which incoming first-years can interact with one another, acquaint themselves with Harvard alongside their leaders, and make a successful transition into college life.

FOP has been well-received since its inception. In the early years, FOP received 200 to 300 applications each year, which swelled to a record level of more than 600 applications in 1996. (Fortunately, the creation of additional pre-orientation programs has allowed more incoming first-years to participate overall, and the number of FOP participants has stabilized to roughly 400 incoming students.) On campus, FOP has attracted increased interest among students who are interested in becoming program leaders. The program consistently receives more than 120 applications for new leaders each year.

The types of trips that FOP has offered have evolved over the program’s history to meet the diverse needs of incoming students. Initially, FOP sent first-years on hiking and climbing trips. Bicycling trips were also provided for a short period from 1984–1988 but were discontinued due to safety concerns. Currently, FOP offers wilderness trips in backpacking, switch-canoe, and service. There are also two types of site-based trips: site-based service and cabin-based site exploration.

The program has been supported by the generous contributions of hundreds of leader alumni, families of participants, and friends of FOP over the years. Since 2015, FOP has committed to providing all eligible students financial aid for participant fees and equipment rental that matches their financial support from Harvard College.

FOP is led by a Steering Committee composed of several undergraduates and a staff director. The Steering Committee is responsible for selecting and training new leaders, planning and organizing trips, and managing the administration of the program throughout the academic year. FOP operates as a pre- orientation program of the Harvard College Freshman Dean’s Office.

Our main goals for the hundreds of FOPpers are as follows:
- Improve the transition from high school to Harvard
- Make friends with fellow first-years and older students who can support and encourage each
other
- Learn about cooperation, initiative, and endurance in a wilderness setting, leading to insights which may transfer to life at Harvard
- Develop a sense of community and a positive connection with Harvard as a whole (including a commitment to public service)

We expect that leaders and FOPpers will find many ways to realize these goals during and after the trips. In fact, one of your most important jobs as a leader (second only to managing risks on your trip) is to impart these goals to your FOPpers. Many additional goals can also be cited for FOP, including: increasing self-confidence; assuming responsibility for oneself and one’s choices; improving communication skills; developing toleration and respect for individual differences that will continue at Harvard; learning to work well with peers; and increasing your trust of others. Clearly, every FOPper will have a uniquely personal experience in our program, but we hope that many of these goals can be realized to some extent during and after their week on FOP.

FOP is often characterized as "an introduction to Harvard that takes place in the woods," and FOPpers will indeed begin their trip by being introduced to each other and to their leaders. They will have the opportunity to ask many questions of their leaders and hear various tales of Harvard life. We hope that leaders will give a lot of thought to the ups and downs of the first year at Harvard and try to prepare FOPpers in a positive and encouraging way for the opportunities that lie ahead. Try to think broadly both about your own experiences and about those of friends and acquaintances, so that you can give your FOPpers as full and accurate a picture as possible. Your perspective may be the first presentation to Harvard the FOPpers receive, so be conscious of the way in which you present yourselves, FOP, and Harvard as a whole.

We realize that FOP will often "stretch the comfort zones" of FOPpers. Not only may some FOPpers be unfamiliar with the outdoors, but they also might be anxious about leaving home and embarking on their college careers. As leaders, it is important that you recognize their concerns and help them adjust by making them comfortable and excited about Harvard. Providing a safe and supportive environment will help the FOPpers make the transition to college and will help ensure that they enjoy the trip.
