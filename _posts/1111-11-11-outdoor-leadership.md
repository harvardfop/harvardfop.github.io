"Leadership is the capacity to move others towards goals shared with you, with a focus and competency they would not achieve on their own." - John Graham, Outdoor Leadership

The special opportunities for learning that exist on FOP are due in large part to its setting: the woods. This section is about how FOP and other outdoor programs have envisioned the process of outdoor leadership, which includes learning, teaching, understanding, and facilitating safe group dynamics and problem solving in the wilderness.

### The Full Value Contract and Group Living

#### Group Ideals

Building community and working together as a team requires lots of energy. A good trip is not one without personality differences or misunderstandings, but one in which conflicts are addressed through open and supportive communication.

On FOP, both leaders and FOPpers constantly work towards group ideals. First, each person should expect that he/she would participate to the best of his/her ability while on a trip. That means sharing, helping, adding and joining to make the trip more fun and meaningful. It means compromising to reach a common goal and being a part of the celebration after reaching that goal. Second, each member will show respect for different cultures within his or her group and in the areas you travel. This means we can learn from people with different traditions, cultures and backgrounds. It is vital for each participant to respect himself or herself, each member of the group, the group as a whole, the FOP organization and the world and people that surround him or her.

#### Full Value

The "Full Value" contract is the best set of principles we have found for healthy group communication. "Full Value" means that everyone has an equal value. Discounting occurs when someone is treated as if he or she is worth less than his or her full value. Most non-FOP groups do not treat everyone as though they have the same value. A strong, intelligent, outgoing person may be listened to and encouraged to take risks, while someone who is different from the others may be ignored and not included in decisions. At FOP, the Full Value Contract is our behavioral contract, at all levels in the organization. While on FOP, each member of your trip should carry out this policy to the best of his her or her ability.

Discounts can be intentional or unintentional. What we are trying to do is prevent the intentional discounts from happening and resolve situations when unintentional discounts occur.

A group that functions with minimal discounting of each other improves the relationships between group members and maximizes everyone's success. We have found the following principles to be extremely helpful in creating a supportive and open group atmosphere, one in which everyone feels comfortable being him or herself. Try to remember these points and put them into use during your trip and even in the rest of your life.

### The "No Discount" Policy

- Don't discount yourself: Self-destructive statements and attitudes like "I can't do it" or "I'm too (stupid, fat, lazy, etc.) to be able to do it," affect both yourself and others within the group. At FOP we expect you to value yourself first. You have value, and your ideas are important.
- Don't discount others: Put-downs like "you're too slow" or "don't be stupid" hurt other members of your group. At FOP we expect that you will assume others are trying their best. People should not be motivated by fear of other people's opinions. This is an ineffective way to inspire others. If you have feedback for a person, see the communication section.
- Don't discount the group: Participating in group activities and willingness to help others is treating the group at full value. Being aware of group plans and needs is an important part of being on an expedition. Being late, not doing your share of group tasks, and not promoting a safe environment are all ways to discount the group.
- Don't discount FOP: Each and every person on a trip is a representative of the FOP organization. We travel through many areas and see the same hikers, campground owners, etc. for many years. Your behavior and the behavior of your group can have an impact on how our groups will be treated in following years. Respect FOP by understanding this and watching your behavior. Consider yourself an ambassador of the First-Year Outdoor Program.
- Speak your truth: Sometimes we don't say what is on our minds, which can be a form of discounting the group by keeping our truths to ourselves. It may be easier not to share, but a FOP trip is not about being easy. Learning to have a voice and say difficult things is a skill that will help your FOPpers at Harvard and in life. Encourage FOPpers to share what is true for them. It is an important practice and gets to the heart of engaging everyone in the community.
- Be willing to listen: This is the key to maintaining an environment of open communication. It is likely that there will be times when someone confronts you and it is important to listen to that person in an attempt to understand him or her. It is not easy to confront or be confronted, and the more accepting we are of each other's efforts, the healthier we will all be.

There are many different ways that you can introduce these ideas to your group. Here a few suggestions:

- Write and sign a Full Value Contract
- Circle Ingredients: a circle with features you want to have on your trip on the inside (e.g. honesty), and those you don't want (e.g. selfishness) on the outside. Often done with the "circle" as an outline of the group's hands on a bandanna, crazy-creek chair, etc.
- Group contract establishing group goals

#### Situational Leadership

The important point to remember is that there is no one "best" way to be a leader. Rather, in each situation there may be a style that will be most effective, or multiple styles might be equally effective. As situations change, the tasks change and so do the proficiency levels of the group. Throughout the trip you will be changing your style in order to provide the most effective leadership.

Different leadership styles may vary with:

- Risk management
- Motivation of the participants
- Trip situations/activities

This concept is derived from the theory of Situational Leadership (STL) as developed by Hersey and Blanchard, 1982. This is one of many current theories on leadership that support the idea that different leadership styles are effective in different situations. This theory deals with how much direction the leaders give, the degree of emotional support the leader provides, and the level of proficiency of the participants at a particular task. STL defines four general styles of leadership:

- Telling/Directing/Structuring (also known as high task/ high relationship behavior) is a style of leadership where the leader provides most of the direction. With two-way communication and emotional support, the leader also attempts to get the participants excited about the decisions. For example, this style is often used when you are teaching skills to your FOPpers in an interactive manner.
- Selling/Coaching/Resolving (also known as high task/low relationship behavior) is a style characterized by one-way communication in which the leader defines the roles of the participants and tells them what, how, when, and where to do various tasks. An example might be when you describe a policy such as the requirement of always wearing footwear.
- Participating/Supporting/Collaborating (also known as low task/high relationship behavior) is a style where participants share in decision making through two-way communication and facilitation with the leader. After having informed FOPpers about a situation you may, for example, involve them in decisions such as where/when to stop for lunch.
- Delegating/Validating (also known as low task/low relationship behavior) the style of leadership involves letting the participants "run their own show." The leader delegates since the participants are proficient with skills. Towards the end of the week, for example, FOPpers may begin and complete tasks such as tarp building of their own volition.

Remember, however, that these are not distinct and definite leadership styles; instead they simply help define a continuous spectrum of leadership styles that vary across situations and groups. Also, your leadership may not necessarily progress through these stages but may switch back and forth. This model simply allows you to assess the group's readiness to accept responsibility for directing its own behavior, as well as to monitor its progress through the stages of group development. (Most of this information on STL was taken from the Princeton University Outdoor Action Leader's Manual, Third Edition.)

### Being A Leader

"Leadership has to do with how people are. You don't teach people a different way of being, you create conditions so that they can discover where their natural leadership comes from." - Peter Senge

There are many different styles and approaches to leadership. Below is a list, not ranked, of general traits of a good, effective and safe leader. The most important leadership task for a FOP leader is ensuring the safety of each individual participant.

#### Recognizing Individual Needs

- You should constantly monitor your needs since you must take care of yourself first and since you serve as a gauge for others' needs (e.g. if you're cold, your FOPpers are probably twice as cold, and you won't be able to effectively help them since you'll be preoccupied with your own freezing fingers). Remember always: self-care comes first.
- You should constantly monitor FOPpers individual needs and expectations.
- Always remember the basic needs of FOPpers, your co, and yourself: Hunger, Thirst, Warmth, Shelter, and Perception of Safety. Meeting these needs will ensure a safer, happier and more motivated group, while making other leadership responsibilities easier for you.
- Make sure every FOPper understands the guidelines and expectations of FOP and is willing to comply with them. By establishing high standards for yourself, you will inspire confidence in your FOPpers and motivate them to achieve. Provide by example:
    - Be safety consciousness, with an emphasis on prevention and risk management
    - Embrace openness and honesty
    - Respect every individual
    - Respect the natural environment
    - Embody personal cleanliness and camp hygiene
    - Respect equipment and personal property
    
#### Recognizing and Facilitating Safe Group Dynamics

Awareness of group dynamics, development of all individuals, and development of a sense of unity are all important parts of FOP. Facilitation of group dynamics is based on careful observation of each individual in the group. Recognize fears and help FOPpers to overcome them. Make use of each person's strengths. Some people are good at cheering the group up with stories and jokes. Some people are good at getting jobs done quickly and efficiently; others are more focused on interpersonal relationships than the actual camping trip itself. It is differences of personality that make each group so unique, with its own special group dynamic.

You have a group of 8-10 people who begin with no direct connection to each other. At the beginning, the group is only an arbitrary collection of individual names destined to spend a week together in the outdoors. Although it is not always a linear progression and some groups will not progress as far as others, here are the general stages of group development. This model is one of the most widely accepted stage models of group development. Think of the "evolution" game...

##### Forming

The first day of FOP is full of insecurities, preliminary conversations, and probing of personalities. FOPpers have just left home, are anticipating their first year at college, and are in an environment that is unfamiliar to them. For some, it may be the first time in the outdoors and they may have different comfort levels (for example, with sleeping outside, going to the bathroom in the woods, not showering, etc.). The basic question for everyone is "am I going to fit into this group?" At this point, leaders set the tone and boundaries for what the group behavior will be. Remember the critical importance of your first impression as a leader. This process may continue beyond the first day. Some possible initiatives to use at this stage are a trust walk or "the longest line," but any get-to-know-you game is good at this time.

##### Storming

In the next phase, FOPpers are starting to become more comfortable and are willing to take more risks. Each one wants to feel that he or she has an influence on the group. It is also a stage where the established boundaries are being questioned, and FOPpers may begin to challenge leaders' authority. It is crucial to remain firm in the guidelines and parameters you have set. Also, it is important to prevent cliques from forming and to emphasize that FOPpers can and should assume responsibility for their role in the group. For example, it is important to stimulate relationships between ALL members of the group by having people hike, sleep next to, or canoe with someone different each day. Another way to do this is to foster group pride in activities such as cooking dinner, raising the bear-bag, inventing creative tarp designs, etc.

##### A Note on Roles

In trying to fit themselves into the group, individuals generally take on roles, which can be positive or negative. As a leader, you can have a positive impact on the roles individuals adopt.

Bill Preble, NEC professor, tells a story of an elementary school student who had the role of a troublemaker. This student would walk up to older students and punch them. The typical reaction was to shower the troublemaker with attention, all of it negative and hurtful, but attention nonetheless. Bill, being aware of this role being played out, gave the student a new role to play, that of a magician. The student, after learning magic tricks from a professional became a positive force in the school, entertaining students and receiving positive attention.

Look for strengths in FOPpers that can be translated into positive roles for them to play. These can include things like expert-tarpitect, the chef, the team builder, leader, listener, group comedian, hydration master or time keeper. Try to find positive roles that you, as a leader, can help FOPpers develop. In the storming stage of group development, this is what a group will be looking for. You should keep in mind that role encouragement is a tool to move through this stage in-group development and ultimately the idea is to be able to move past these roles.

##### Norming

The group has learned, indirectly through role modeling and/or directly through guidance from the leaders, how to respectfully resolve conflicts and value differences. Ideally, everyone now recognizes the resources within the group, help is asked for and support received, and leadership is shared between group members. It may be hard at this stage to know when to step in to lead and when to hang back and let the group work things out. Use your judgment, and remember you are the leader!

##### Performing

Not all groups get to this level, or even passed the forming stage. However, the "Performing" stage of group development occurs when a group recognizes each others strengths and weaknesses so effectively that they can successfully complete challenges and tasks, while also resolving, valuing and learning from the differences of opinion among them.

##### Termination/Transference

This stage occurs at the end of the trip when FOPpers are feeling anxious about the transition to college. As a result, FOPpers may become less attentive. This process is particularly noticeable when FOPpers return to campus for the gear de-issue. As the leader, this may be a good time to encourage FOPpers to think about how the FOP experience can be transferred to their lives and their transition to Harvard.

#### Communication

"Speak your truth." Open and frequent communication is essential on FOP. It will help individuals work as a group and make thoughtful decisions that incorporate everyone's point of view. In particular, communication between leaders is especially important. Knowing how your co is feeling and offering clear and honest indications of your thoughts and feelings will help you to work more effectively as a team and to present a unified front to your FOPpers. During Pre-FOP, be sure to go over the "Before and After FOP" sections of the handbook with your co!

Below are some suggestions for open communication:

##### Sending Information

- Use "I" statements. They allow you to "own" your feelings without placing responsibility on the other individual (ex: "I really like it when you..." or, "It makes me uncomfortable when you...")
- Express your feelings using specifics, expressions, and words.
- Describe the other's individual behavior without interpreting or judging their actions. 
- Ask for and openly receive feedback on how the other individual is feeling about your statements.
- Be conscious of the message that you are sending with your non-verbal behavioral cues (e.g. body language, facial expressions).

##### Receiving Information

- Check your own understanding of what the person stated by responding, "I hear you saying _____."
- Describe what you think to be the sender's feelings.
- Pay attention to your co-leader's non-verbal behavioral cues.
- Engage in active listening! While you are listening, ask yourself: what does the co or FOPper really mean? What are the feelings involved? Pay attention to what he/she is NOT saying too.

Communication with the Director and the Steering Committee is equally important; you should feel free to approach them with any questions or concerns. On the trail, keep communication with your co and your FOPpers open and constant. Be aware of how your FOPpers are doing by observing their behavior and listening to what they are saying. Remember that your FOPpers are coming from a variety of backgrounds, so you may have to make an extra effort to understand what they are saying from their point of view. It is easy to screen others' comments with your own values and biases. You must try to remove this personal screen to achieve true awareness and acceptance of others.

#### Skill Instruction Method/Teaching Suggestions

FOP is a program of experiential education, meaning that learning is primarily achieved by doing. There is a greater likelihood that your trip will be safe if you teach FOPpers to be responsible and care for themselves, others, gear and the environment. Also, keep in mind that there are several learning styles and try to incorporate more than one in each of your presentations. Remember also to use your handbook: look over what it has to say about the topic, and how it says it, beforehand. Here's a 4-step method of instruction to use as a FOP leader:

1. Introduction: Pick a time when the FOPpers are comfortable, rested, and ready to learn. Get them excited about learning the skill.
	- Get FOPpers' attention and tell them why they should learn the skill.
	- Name the skill you are teaching.
	- Use stories to convey the importance of knowing the skill.
	- Provide background information: the goals and objectives, the purpose of the skill and when, where, how, and why it is used.
2. Presentation: Make it easy and fun for FOPpers to follow your demonstration.
	- Use a logical learning sequence building on prior knowledge and experience of FOPpers.
	- Show the whole skill first, then break it into parts, and finally show the skill in slow motion.
	- Speak slowly and point out the key points of the skill.
	- Make it interesting!
3. Practice: Have FOPpers practice the skill.
	- Watch for errors and correct them immediately.
	- Give positive reinforcement ("Your skillz are crazy good!!!!"). 
	- Get the FOPpers to teach and practice with each other.
4. Application: Encourage FOPpers to use the skill in future situations. 
	- Next time they can perform it without help.
	- Have the participant teach the skill to others.
	- Review the skill periodically.

#### Problem Solving

There will be problems. How should you deal with them in the group setting? 

- Define the problem and recognize its repercussions throughout the group.
- Gather facts.
- Identify possible alternatives.
- Select the best one. Maybe there isn't a "best" one; discuss options, select one, and be happy with your decision! No regrets!
- Take action. Everyone should be willing to pitch in. 

#### Conflict Resolution

Below are some considerations when handling an interpersonal conflict:

- You must accept the person, but you do not have to accept the behavior.
- Be sensitive. Think about the emotional safety of everyone on the trip.
- Refer to and quote FOP Policy when addressing a FOPper's behavior.
- Immediately address inappropriate language, remarks or behavior. You do not want to condone the action by allowing it "to slide."

#### Conclusion

As a FOP leader you must be able to make sound judgments in relation to weather conditions, individual hikers, health, and other issues. Your role as a FOP leader calls for continued leadership. Hopefully the FOP trip will not be about the competency and success of the leaders, but rather about the competency and success of the group as a whole. Ideally towards the end of the trip, the FOPpers will be taking responsibility for setting up camp and offering opinions in the decision making processes. This stage is not always attainable for every group, but it is nevertheless an ideal to strive for. Finally, always maintain open communication with each FOPper, the group, your co-leader, the Steering Committee and the Director.

### Co-Leader Dynamics

The Steering Committee makes every effort to pair people who will bring complementary strengths and weaknesses to the job. Generally this works out smoothly and, with a little effort and communication, good leader dynamics are easily achieved. Sometimes, however, things do not happen so easily and you must be prepared to work issues out with your co-leader. FOP considers getting along with your co-leader "part of the job." You must, and you can, get along on the trip. Co-leaders need to talk regularly even when there don't seem to be any pressing issues; you need to listen to each other and express views as openly as possible. If there are serious problems, talk to the Steering Committee or the Director.

Decisions almost always should be reached together, except when some emergency or crisis requires instantaneous action; even then, you should discuss things together as soon as the situation permits. You are partners, comrades, mates, buddies, a team...so work together! The following factors make the most difference in establishing good co-leader dynamics.

#### Recognizing Differences in Personality

Some difficulties on FOP trips can arise because leaders have different personalities. One leader may like to take two long breaks during the day and avoid a lot of short breaks; the other leader may prefer many shorter rest stops. One leader may prefer slow starts in the morning whereas the other likes to hit the trail early. Obviously neither person in either situation is wrong or right: they are simply different. Acknowledging such differences and talking about them early on makes resolutions much easier.

#### Recognizing Differences in Leadership Style

Some leaders prefer to be more aggressive, or directive, in their approach, while others are fairly passive, or non-directive. At certain times and in certain situations, each technique has its merits. Before you go on the trip, get a good idea of both your own and your co-leader's style. Anticipate situations where you might have to modify your own leadership style for the benefit of the group. It is also important to avoid dichotomous roles. There should never be a situation where one leader is the disciplinarian and the other is the fun leader.

#### Communicating as Often as Possible

This may sound obvious, but few of us do it as well as we may think. Talk as much before the trip as possible, and establish a "caring" kind of relationship. If you let each other know how you feel about the decisions that are being made and about how the trip is going, difficulties will come out into the open while they are still small and easy to deal with. Talk about issues before they become bigger problems. It is a good idea to establish a time apart from FOPpers each day to talk with your co-leader and get feedback from him/her; ask each other for opinions and comments ("constructive criticism") on your leadership and interactions with the group.

You must always let your co know where you are and what you are doing. This is imperative for obvious safety reasons. It is also crucial for creating an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.

Communication is also essential for maximizing your collective skill. Use one an- other's strengths and expertise to the fullest!

#### Checking In

One of the most important aspects of co-leader communication is the check-in. All co-leading pairs have different styles, with some checking in at every juncture while others will check in at each break. What’s constant is that checking in happens. Some reasons it is important to normalize checking in often, regardless of absolute necessity, include: your FOPpers won’t realize it if you are lost, you can take care of yourself and your co in private, you can bond with your co away from the FOPpers (think: eating co snacks), you can plan for the next part of the day, and many more. Check-ins go a long way toward establishing a strong co-leader relationship and should be utilized often.

A basic check-in usually includes some or all of the following questions:
- [Lead Self and Co] How are you feeling physically? Emotionally? Each co checks in with themselves.
- [Lead Group] How do you feel like the group is doing physically? Emotionally? Socially? Maybe just quickly name each member and say if there's anything up.
- [Looking Forward] Any pressing concerns? What are our plans for the next few hours? How do we do this successfully? What's our first step after we finish checking in? How are you feeling now?

#### Respect Each Other and Each Other's Opinions

Work together as a team when making decisions. You should discuss any decision and present yourselves as united. It is important that you do not undermine each other by arguing in front of your group. You should always present a unified front to your FOPpers. If you do have disagreements, talk about them in private and work them out quietly. If you argue and fight with each other, your FOPpers will lose respect for you both and may lose confidence in you as well. This is not a good thing!

It is important for returning leaders to give new leaders equal rank in making decisions. While returning leaders may feel tempted to teach from their own experiences, new leaders will learn more from their own trial-and-error of different games and ways to set up tarps (providing, of course, that safety is not jeopardized). Remember always to go conservative; if you and your co simply cannot agree, let the more conservative option win out.

Even if you may not feel like best friends, realize that every FOP leader is well trained and competent and deserves respect both professionally and personally. It is your job to give each other this respect and work out any problems or disagreements. If you get along, the FOPpers will feel it; if you don't, they'll feel that too. You owe it to them to have a healthy, communicative, respectful, working professional relationship.

It's important to start co-leader communication as early as possible. Be sure that you and your co go over the co-leading inventory in your handbook and leader packet.
